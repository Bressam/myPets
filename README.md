# My Pets - Hybrid App
Flutter hybrid application, runs on multiple platforms, mostly focused on mobile (iOS and Android), but can also run on chrome, macOS and windows.
This is just and academic project to study hybdrid development using Flutter. 
As an iOS developer, I wanted to understand simple components and behaviors that are common to usual applications. So this applications may look simple, but it uses a lot of common components and ideas that improves and build a good knowledge and understanging of flutter that would be important on more complex projects.
